                            The Endangered Species Act provides for the protection of endangered and threatened species of wildlife and plants. When non-Federal parties plan to interact with ecosystems containing such species, it is required by <a href='https://www.fws.gov/laws/endangered-species-act/section-10'>Section 10(a)(2)(A)</a> of the Act to develop a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP). HCPs must meet the permit issuance criteria of section <a href="https://www.fws.gov/laws/endangered-species-act/section-10">10(a)(2)(B)</a> of the Endangered Species Act. HCPs can also include conservation measures for vulnerable plant and animal species that are not listed federally as endangered or threatened.

                            <br><br> The habitat conservation plan associated with the permit ensures that the effects of the authorized incidental take are adequately minimized and mitigated.
                            
                            <br><br>According to the <a href='https://www.fws.gov/service/habitat-conservation-plans'>Service</a>:
                            "A Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) is a planning document designed to accommodate economic development to the extent possible by authorizing the limited and unintentional take of listed species when it occurs incidental to otherwise lawful activities. The plan is designed not only to help landowners and communities but also to provide long-term benefits to species and their habitats. HCPs describe the anticipated effects of the proposed taking, how those impacts will be minimized or mitigated, and how the conservation measures included in the plan will be funded."
                            
                            <br><br> <i>Before drafting the HCP, it is strongly recommended to consult with the local field office of the Service to determine whether the HCP meets the respective policy and incidental take permit issuance criteria. Find your local field office <a href='https://www.fws.gov/our-facilities?state_name=%5B%22Virginia%22%5D'>here<a>. 
                            Check for existing HCPs that individual landowners can join – programmatic HCPs – before drafting your own. Programmatic HCPs are often county- or even region-wide.</i>

                            An incidental take permit is required if otherwise lawful activities may unintentionally result in any "take" of endangered or threatened animal species. A completed Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) must accompany any application for an incidental take permit. If the Service finds that an HCP meets the Endangered Species Act section <a href=’https://www.fws.gov/laws/endangered-species-act/section-10’>10(a)(1)(B)</a> incidental take permit issuance criteria, they will unlock the incidental take permit application. The applicant must then submit the completed incidental take permit (with the associated HCP) to the Service.
